<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


This project aims to build a miniature version of GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) named picoGPT, which involves creating a smaller transformer neural network with fewer layers and fewer hidden units, which can be trained on a small corpus of text data for specific NLP tasks. The steps involved in building a miniature GPT model include data preparation, tokenization, defining the model architecture, pre-training the model, fine-tuning the model on downstream NLP tasks, evaluating the model's performance, and deploying the model in a production environment. Building a miniature GPT model requires a good understanding of natural language processing, machine learning, and deep learning, and it can be a useful exercise for researchers like us who want to experiment with smaller and more efficient models that can be deployed on resource-constrained devices.
